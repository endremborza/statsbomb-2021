### Paper Title

*max 500 words on:*

### What are you researching?

How can we improve the accuracy of predicting success of a transfer.

Attributes of team a player comes from? Attributes of the league? Common characteristics of opponents? "Winning mentality"? Proven success after environment change?

### Why do you think this is an interesting question?

Because teams have spent in excess of the yearly GDP of the Central African Republic on players who ended up either playing very poorly or not playing at all, due to noone wanting to buy them and pay their wages.

### What is your expected outcome?

We might find that it matters less whether a player comes from seemingly different circumstances, but it matters more if they can generally adapt or not.

## Notes

### Questions to address

- Coming up with a good transfer success metric
- Determining the scope of the data (statsbomb recommnds keeping external sources "minimal")
- fitting in style metrics

### Useful things
- [This](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/) data formalization and parsing will probably be useful
